# üññ Welcome Carbon Unit! (_human_) 

I'm Abhimanyu, a passionate developer and builder of good things ‚ú®(_the goal_). Some folks call me "A Bee" or Obhi, who truly believe in me and trust me to be working on real-world solutions with a major positive impact üå†üå†. While that may be true, I usually work on stuff that fascinates me the most and which eventually turns out to be **impactful** and **interesting** enough that people take over it to further research and development. I‚Äôm always learning new technologies and improving my skills in computer science, and computer games.  üéÆ

## üëΩ About Me 

### Current Projects

I‚Äôm currently working on innovative projects in **[Linear Phase Array](https://github.com/a2nath/Linear-Phased-Array)** that visualizes antenna patterns for linear scan arrays. Another project that has always fascinated me is wireless over long distances **[Wi-Fi LongDistance](https://github.com/a2nath/Long-Distance-Wi-Fi-802.11)** which demonstrates the feasibility of packets traveling over several kilometers if frequency and propagation-times were not an issue (_modified **IEEE802.11** communication protocol_) over VHF/UHF bands

### My Coding Breakdown


I love writing `C++` projects with scripted wrappers. Something close to low level such as `C` and `C++` helps me with performance code that will run complex calculations quickly such as in simulations and hardware modeling. Any ASIC or IP modeling helps me simulate the part of the chip behavior that is valuable in the design and analysis phase. Then wrap it up with `python`, `bash` and other scripting languages to compile and run the code (`cmake`, `bash`).

## Lessons learned from the industry

###  If you buy a _Lamborghini_, you  maintain the _Lamborghini_

In my 10+ years of working in various tech companies including Google, Qualcomm, Open Text, and the Canadian Government, when working in the semiconductor industry for various large corporations there are truly some enlightening and contradictory things that can be learned. In my experience projects evolve from their first line of code to a development timeframe of 5-10+ years involving 100s of engineers that are needed to maintain a large-scale unsustainable solution; growing uncontrollably from various project targets, feature releases, and new goals of the organization:

</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ancient-trireme-battle.jpg?raw=true" width="500"/>
</p>

As the project grows to a monstrosity and it gets more and more difficult to scale up the modules, the most concerned person or the tech lead who has influence and say in the matter has to step up and initiate a cleanup of the code, also called the **_tech debt_**. If there isn't already a consecutive delivery due just after a major delivery that got done from a 10-month grind, the person leading the team has to step back and look for slack in the project timeline where this tech debt can be paid off as fully as possible.

### Big chaos to Big structure

Maybe the engineers in the team won't have the time to pay this debt fully, but despite the challenge, the goal is to make things run smoothly in the future and more efficiently when onboarding new contributors to the project. Because let's face it, training costs money. Training takes away the valuable time that could have gone towards the development and testing of new features. Here's the evolution of a well-developed project with a fully mature automation and regression toolchain, validation pipeline, CI/CD, etc. (_in my opinion_ üëΩ):

</p>

It's counter-intuitive, I know.

In the ASIC industry, by doing this, we're cutting down clock cycles and more importantly ASIC power. Less code that passes the test coverage including edge conditions while not creating a scope of more bugs or edge conditions is a win! Less code is a smaller attack surface, and therefore, less is truly more.

### Collaborate on open-source projects: [**_Unreal Engine_**](https://www.youtube.com/unrealengine) and [**_SpecialK_**](https://github.com/SpecialKO/SpecialK) modding tools

If someone has the statistical probability model for the unit conversions in the original _Age of Empires,_ please [dm](https://discord.gg/RDth4bMH6v) me! üì¢ 
I would like to look at the algorithm and plot some probability graphs against the modern versions for fun. ‚öîÔ∏è üõ°Ô∏è üó°Ô∏è

### Fun fact

I hyperfocus on computer graphics, and have a pretty strong obsession with game engine stuff, but I hope some alternate version of me in this multiverse is an _Age of Empires_ developer at **_Forgotten Empires_**, who is enjoying everything that life has to offer. Here's an example of a house I made in **_Unreal Engine 4.0_** with a fireplace and some cozy chairs.

</p>

Because most of my time is taken by ASIC stuff, this is long overdue.. to make a much larger game setting, add more sprites and the greatest pathfinding algorithm that'll allow _NPCs_ to walk to their destinations without micromanaging or watchdog timeouts or corrections from the game engine itself. As well as react appropriately to the player.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, and reading some of the pointless stuff that concerns no one probably, but those who care may be able to keep reminding me about these early aspirations. Feel free to check out my repositories and let's connect!
