# ðŸ–– Welcome Carbon Unit! (_human_) 
I'm Abhimanyu, a passionate developer and builder of good things âœ¨(_the goal_). Some folks call me "A Bee" or Obhi, who truly believe in me and trust me to be working on real-world solutions with a major positive impact ðŸŒ ðŸŒ . While that may be true, I usually work on stuff that fascinates me the most and which eventually turns out to be **impactful** and **interesting** enough that people take over it to further research and development. Iâ€™m always learning new technologies and improving my skills in computer science, and computer games.  ðŸŽ®

  
## ðŸ‘½ About Me 

### Current Projects

Iâ€™m currently working on innovative projects in **[Linear Phase Array](https://github.com/a2nath/Linear-Phased-Array)** that help visualize antenna patterns for linear scan arrays. Another project that has always fascinated me is wireless over long distances **[Wi-Fi LongDistance](https://github.com/a2nath/Long-Distance-Wi-Fi-802.11)** which demonstrates the feasibility of packets traveling over several kilometers if frequency and propagation times were not an issue (_modified **IEEE802.11** communication protocol_) over VHF/UHF bands

## Lessons learned from the industry

###  If you buy a Lamborghini, you  have to maintain the Lamborghini

I have a personal philosophy of keeping things simple, instead of overcomplicating things that will require re-learning what the code does! And not to mention the amount of time in maintenance of complicated code when dependent things break. In my 10+ years of working in various large tech companies including Google, Qualcomm, Open Text, and the Canadian Government, I learned some truly enlightening, intuitive as well as contradictory things. As you might expect, projects evolve from their infancy and look like this: 

<p align="center">

</p>

... and eventually reaching a state where in 5-10+ years of development time, 100s of engineers are involved to maintain a large-scale unsustainable solution; growing uncontrollably from various having to meet targets, feature releases, and aim for new goals of the organization. In the figure below, a trireme has 3 rows of rowers on each side, which can bring the total crew count to 150-200 that are actively involved in running this ship. Just imagine.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/trireme-1.jpg?raw=true" width="500"/>
</p>

As the project grows further, it gets more and more difficult to scale up the modules. Moreover, the concerned person or the tech lead who has a say in the project timeline has to step up and initiate a cleanup of the code, also called the **_tech debt_**. One person cannot do this which further warrants the help of another entire team that becomes responsible for the tools and deployment of the software going forward. Now to keep things running smoothly in a trireme, what if I said that we will need to create a large floating platform that's connected to the ship by several cables and ladders so that they help organize the daily operations?

</p>

If there isn't already a consecutive delivery due just after a major delivery that got done from a 10-month grind, the person leading the team has to step back and look for slack in the project timeline where this tech debt can be paid off as fully as possible. And oftentimes in the tech sector, back-to-back projects are a thing... so remember, don't overcomplicate stuff or else **if you buy a Lamborghini, you have to maintain the Lamborghini**

<br/>

In a well-developed project the evolution of a project as it matures has automated testing, regression toolchain, and a thorough validation pipeline, CI/CD, etc. (_in my opinion_ ðŸ‘½). Yes, it does look super simple, and yet it can be complex the more a developer in your team digs deeper, but the "feeling" is never that it's complicated. It is counter-intuitive.

## Pending Projects

This is long overdue for meâ€”to make a much larger game setting, add more sprites, and use the greatest pathfinding algorithm that'll allow NPCs to walk to their destinations without micromanaging, watchdog timeouts, corrections from the game itself, or reacting appropriately to the player.

## My Coding Breakdown

I love writing `C++` projects with scripted wrappers to drive the core binary. Something close to low-level such as `C` and `C++` helps with understanding the chip behavior, which is valuable in the system design and pre-silicon stage as well as risk-analysis of power and performance. `Python` has also been pretty instrumental in deploying tools quickly and writing custom MDPs that will interact with AI tools such as Open AI's [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium).

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, and reading some of the preachy stuff that probably does not concern you (yet), and those who care may be able to keep reminding me about these early aspirations and struggles. Feel free to check out my repositories and let's connect!
